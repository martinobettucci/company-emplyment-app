For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

The app search for a company and given a list of relevant sources, it will prepare a newsletter to be sent to the subscribers. It uses 2 API.

The first API collects the sources, the second prepare the email.

The first API is on https://n8n.p2enjoy.studio/webhook-test/1bab15e1-213c-4ba0-88ca-a665f77b3ad8 and is expecting a POST request with a payload like this exemple:
```json
[
  {
    "company": "APPLE"
  }
]
```
The first API will responds back with a JSON like this exemple:
```json

  {
    "companyName": "APPLE",
    "searchResults": {
